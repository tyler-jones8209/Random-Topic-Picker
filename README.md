# Random-Topic-Picker
Some Python code that I can use to pick a random topic regarding certain cultures to just learn about for a bit.

I might update it with some sort of GUI. A spinning wheel for each option would be cool, like a wheel spins and picks Korean, then another picks Language, and the last one picks Hangugeo or something. I'll probably just work on this for like a month and then never touch it again though so we'll see.
